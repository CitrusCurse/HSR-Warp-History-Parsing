# HSR-Warp-History-Parsing
Using Fluent-Bit (specifically LUA scripts) you can parse Honkai Star Rail Warp History data to individual events. Although I also threw in a Splunk TA too since I made it before I knew what Fluent-Bit was.

To see any of these lua scripts in action, check out the Calyptia Sandbox.

NOTICE: I still need to add all of the required configs if you want to use Fluent-Bit. WIP.
